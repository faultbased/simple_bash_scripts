# simple_bash_scripts

## Experimenting with little shell scripts of my own making!

### Files
All the following are scripts:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `idea.sh` | create (5) empty files after prompting user to name each one; **error(s): 5th loop doesn't create empty file.** |
| `it_exist.sh` | user is prompted to input filename and it checks if already exist. And if doesn't *--it'll create it for you!
